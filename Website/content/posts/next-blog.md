# What’s the next game project ?

**‘What’s the next game?’**, 

**‘How will you choose your next game project if you’re just starting out? What will enable your project not only to avoid failure, but also to succeed?** 

I ended up with some ideas on what the requirements might be for a game that is less likely to fail. In my opinion, it should belong to a less competitive genre, appeal to a wide range of ages and have a high potential for downloads.

To give you a better understanding, let’s dive into more details about these requirements:


### **Choosing a Less Competitive Genre :**
Opt for a genre that isn’t crowded. This strategy makes it easier for your game to get noticed because there’s less competition, especially from the big names. For example, breaking into the action game market can be tough if you’re up against companies like Gameloft.


### **Appealing to a Wide Age Range:**
Design your game with minimal age restrictions. This approach not only simplifies the approval process with app stores , but also broadens your potential audience. A game that’s accessible to all ages is more likely to see a higher number of downloads.


### **Ensuring High Potential for Downloads:**
Pay attention to current trends and what games are popular, as this can guide you toward what players are looking for. However, remember to find a balance; aim for genres that are in demand but not oversaturated with competition. This balance can help ensure your game stands out while still attracting a significant number of downloads.


I dove into a bit of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of [Play Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) to answer these questions. I focused on the games category and spent some quality time analyzing it. If you’re curious about all the nitty-gritty details, I’ve got the full report up on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kaGhimaa/Data-analysis-projects/tree/main/what's%20the%20next%20game) for you to check out. Now, let’s chat about some of the cool insights I uncovered from this adventure!.

## What are the Most Competitive Game Genres?

From looking at 1,000 games, it’s clear that the **Action**, **Arcade**, **Racing**, and **Adventure** genres are super competitive. So, right now, we’re steering clear of those genres.




## How Does Age Limitation Affect the Number of Downloads?

Basically, games that **everyone** can enjoy usually get more downloads. It’s like throwing a big party where everyone’s invited, VS making it exclusive to just a few friends. It’s a no-brainer which one will be more popular, right?




## What Are the Most Downloaded Games?

The most in-demand game genres are **casual**, **sports**, **arcade**, and **strategy** games. Just a heads up, we’re not talking about the super competitive ones. When we say “competitive,” we mean there are tons of options out there, which isn’t the best for standing out. But when a game is highly demanded, it means lots of people are downloading it. Think of it like this: the market is all the game companies out there, and downloads are like the customers.




## Which Game Genre Keeps Players Active?

When more people leave reviews for a game, it’s a good sign that lots of folks are playing it. And as you see **strategy** games are stealing the spotlight, showing that players are really getting into those thought-provoking challenges. Next up are **sports** and **casual** games, which are also pretty popular, offering a mix of excitement and relaxed fun for everyone to enjoy.



## RESULT

Feeling the clarity now! Based on the data, We’d say go for either **strategy** or **casual** games. They’re popular and buzzing with excitement, so why not jump in and make something awesome happen? and don’t forget to have fun!
